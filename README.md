A web-based application to chat with a PDF, I mainly do it to not read papers, just ask the important stuff, the app uses Oobabooga es model loader and a RTX 4090 to load guanaco-7b for the inference, but of course you can test with others models that suits your needs and resources. the main characteristic of this project are:

- Streamlit Chatbot interface.
- Langchain to manage the knwoledge creation and context input.
- Running locally on GPU.
- Can save history chat.
- PDF file uploading.
